## Tools & CI/CD

## Usage

## Development

1. Build a basic blockchain with tokens (transactions and wallets)
2. Deploy the blockchain on a peer-to-peer network and start alpha version
3. Handle algorithm to build a bloc every X minutes (10 min for BTC for instance):
    - a bloc contains several transactions, update that quanity of transactions to fit about the X minutes timing 
4. Allow beta users to enter the network and mine goatter coins
5. Improve the algorithms:
    - proof of work algo
    - check out the advantages of a ADLD

## TODO
1. (finish tutorial)
2. handle peer to peer network and deploy on a test network (comprised of our own laptops)
3. checkout more specific proof of work algorithms and other methods
4. acyclic graph: @SpaceAzur ADLD (acyclic Diagram Lead Designer)
5. contact marketing for money raise
